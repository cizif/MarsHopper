## Overview

MarsHopper is a plane for investigation poles and its surroundings on Mars. It uses CO2, that in solid form covers surface as a jet fuel. At landing, plane harvest CO2 for next flight and for its deceleration. On the surface plane accumulates radioisotope energy in CO2, by changing it phase from solid to liquid(or gas). Liquid(or gas) CO2 at high pressure is used as a jet fuel for next jump, with possible short flight, hence the name of plane “hopper”.

To elaborate this idea we estimated viability of the mission in terms of energy consumption and flight condition. Our calculations showed that this project is possible with existing technologies. Also, to illustrate the idea we made computer modeling of flight process and made real life demonstration model of plane launched by jet force of CO2.
