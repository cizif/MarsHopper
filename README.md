## Overview

MarsHopper is a plane for investigation Mars poles and its surroundings. It uses CO2, that in solid form covers surface to create jet thrust. At landing, plane harvests CO2 for next flight and for deceleration. On the surface, plane accumulate radioisotopic energy in CO2, by changing it phase from solid to liquid (or even to supercritical fluid). Liquid (or supercritical fluid) CO2 at high pressure is used as a jet fuel for next jump, with possible short flight, hence the name of plane “hopper”.

To elaborate this idea we estimated viability of the mission in terms of energy consumption and flight condition. Our calculations showed that this project is possible with existing technologies. Also, to illustrate the idea we made computer modeling of flight process and made real life demonstration model of plane launched by jet force of CO2.


## MARSHOPPER DESIGN

## IDEA
The main idea is to use solid CO2 on Mars poles as accumulator of energy with further use it for jet thrust.
Main power sources on existing Mars missions are radioisotope thermoelectric generator and solar panel. Both do not give sufficient power for fast transportation on Mars. One possibility to move fast is to use high-energy fuel from Earth, but it costs too much to deliver hence it is limited. Therefore, there is a necessity to accumulate energy and by rapid release create required force to move things.

We propose to use local resource, solid CO2, to accumulate energy from RTG. The device that realize this idea we called MarsHopper. It is a plane. At landing, plane harvest CO2 and thus slowing down. Than it accumulates radioisotope energy by heating CO2. Rapid release of liquid (or supercritical) CO2 to Mars low-pressure atmosphere will cause transition to gas and rapid expansion. High-pressure gas can be used as a jet thrust for next jump and create rotation of propellers to sustain flight. With multiple jumps, it can investigate large area of Mars poles and its surroundings.
We believe that it can revolutionize the way Mars is explored.
## PHYSICAL CALCULATIONS
You can find approximate estimation of CO2 mass and energy required to flight in [MarsHopper.pdf](https://github.com/cizif/MarsHopper/blob/master/MarsHopper.pdf "Look for details here") file
## MODELING 
### Virtual model
We created virtual model of MarsHopper. This model we put in the virtual environment that resembles surface of Mars. Video on link below demonstrates the process of unpacking, initial landing and further start with jet thrust.

### Demonstration model
We created demonstration model of plane powered by CO2 pressure.

We reached 4atm pressure in the 0.5l bottle.To do this we need only 3g of solid CO2. 
## FUTURE OF MARSHOPPER
We are starting Earth Hopper project. Its aim is to test different technical aspect of future MarsHopper mission. First subproject is to create prototype on earth to test heat transfer system and propulsion system. Second subproject is to test plane by releasing it from aerostat at 35км, to test transformation process and flight process at this altitude that resembles Mars atmosphere. National Space Agency of Ukraine showed interest in our project and we expect on cooperation.
